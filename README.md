# Micro Dungeon Maker

A tool for quick prototyping and designing dungeons for tabletop RPGs. The main features are:

* **Keyboard-first** &mdash; made to be pleasant to use with just the keyboard; mouse is still a valid option.
* **Fast & responsive** &mdash; no frills and needless animations, things happen immediately for rapid workflow.
* **Readable** &mdash; toned but contrasting colors, easy to read and understand the map you made.

Micro Dungeon Maker's job is to make it easy and quick to put an idea to *paper*, see how viable it is and improve.
